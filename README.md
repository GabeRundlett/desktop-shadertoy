Desktop Shadertoy is a desktop client application for Shadertoy projects, allowing enthusiasts to open Shadertoys in profilers and graphics debuggers like Renderdoc or NVIDIA NSight.

Desktop Shadertoy is absolutely a work in progress but it already supports multi-pass shaders such as [this](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msG3zG) or [this](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/stVfWc). All you need to do to use it is create or fork a shadertoy, and go to your profile. There, you'll be able to export it as a json file. Drag and drop this json onto the app window, and it will compile the shadertoy for you!
